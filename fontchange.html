<p id="paragraph">It is rightly said that being disciplined is essential in life. When a person leads a disciplined life, they set an easy path to success. They will develop an approach to happiness and a beautiful future ahead. Being disciplined is the practice of having a scheduled daily routine which helps an individual to be punctual and hard-working. An individual is taught what being disciplined means from the time they are young. Even though discipline takes a lot of effort, the advantages of a disciplined life make it a worthwhile endeavour.</p>
